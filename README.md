# Decentralized Identity Management

This is a decentralized identity management system developed in Solidity for the Ethereum network. It allows users to control their own data and securely share it with third-party applications.

## Setup

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Install [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) or use the online version.
2. Copy and paste the smart contract code into a new file in Remix.
3. Compile the code using the Solidity compiler.
4. Deploy the contract to the Ethereum network of your choice.

## Usage

To use the identity management system, follow these steps:

1. Call the `createUser` function to create a new user with their personal data.
2. Call the `updateUser` function to update a user's personal data.
3. Call the `shareData` function to securely share a user's data with a third-party application.
4. Call the `getUser` function to retrieve a user's personal data.

## Testing

To test the system, follow these steps:

1. Use Remix's testing tools to test each of the functions.
2. Ensure that the system functions correctly and securely.
3. Deploy the system to the Ethereum network of your choice.
